# Temporal GeneTerrain

## About The Project
Temporal GeneTerrain is a groundbreaking visualization tool developed to explore the dynamic changes in gene expression within cancer cell lines over time. This project addresses the critical need for understanding temporal dynamics in disease progression and drug response, which is pivotal in precision medicine and cancer therapy.

The tool integrates multiple time-specific GeneTerrains into a cohesive temporal framework, offering novel insights into gene expression evolution in response to drug perturbations, with a focus on prostate cancer cell lines.

A framework for constructing Temporal GeneTerrains involving two steps: Step-1, Generating the GeneTerrain for visualizing using the network biology of genes and gene signals; Step-2, Stitching the GeneTerrain generated in Step-1 based on their chronological order.
