Temporal GeneTerrain Shiny Application

This repository hosts the Shiny web application for Temporal GeneTerrain, an innovative tool designed to dynamically visualize gene expression changes in cancer cell lines over time in response to various drug treatments. Our application aims to facilitate an interactive exploration of these complex datasets, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and clinicians in the field of precision medicine.
About the Application

The Temporal GeneTerrain Shiny application offers a user-friendly interface for exploring the temporal dynamics of gene expression in cancer research. Users can visualize how gene expressions in cancer cell lines change over time under different drug perturbations, identify genes sensitive or resistant to treatments, and investigate the synergistic effects of drug combinations.
