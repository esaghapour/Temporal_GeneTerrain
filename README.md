\section*{About the Application}

The Temporal GeneTerrain Shiny application is designed to facilitate an interactive exploration of gene expression changes in cancer cell lines over time, under the influence of various drug treatments. This application aims to provide researchers and clinicians in precision medicine with a user-friendly interface for investigating the temporal dynamics of gene expression.

\section*{Getting Started}

To run the Temporal GeneTerrain Shiny application locally, ensure that R and the Shiny package are installed on your system. You can install R from \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN}, and the Shiny package directly within R using the command \texttt{install.packages("shiny")}.

\subsection*{Running the Application}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clone the repository: \texttt{git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Temporal-GeneTerrain-Shiny.git}
    \item In R, set the working directory to the cloned repository: \texttt{setwd("/path/to/Temporal-GeneTerrain-Shiny")}
    \item Run the application: \texttt{shiny::runApp()}
\end{enumerate}

The application will now be accessible through your web browser at the local host address provided by Shiny.

\section*{Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic visualization of gene expression changes across multiple time points.
    \item Analysis of the effects of single and combined drug treatments on cancer cell lines.
    \item Interactive options for in-depth data exploration.
    \item Access to preloaded case studies demonstrating real-world applications.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Contributing}

Contributions to improve the application or add new features are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Detailed contribution guidelines are available in the \texttt{CONTRIBUTING.md} file.
